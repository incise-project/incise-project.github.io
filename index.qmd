From 2016 to 2019, the International Civil Service Effectiveness (InCiSE)
project was a collaboration between the Blavatnik School of Government and the
Institute for Government. It was supported by the UK Civil Service (through the
Cabinet Office) and received funding from the Open Society Foundations.

The InCiSE project has now been archived, this website provides access to the
InCiSE 2019 reports and results dashboard.

## Blavatnik Index of Public Administration
The Blavatnik Index of Public Administration is the spiritual successor to the InCiSE project, building on the foundations of the 2017 and 2019 editions of
the InCiSE Index. The Blavatnik Index was launched in December 2024, using an updated framework it provides comparisons of civil services and public administrations in 120 countries around the world. Visit the
[Blavatnik Index website](https://index.bsg.ox.ac.uk) to view the results
and learn more.
